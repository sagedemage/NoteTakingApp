# go-web-app-experiment

Lets go and have some fun learning about the go programming language while using the Gin web framework.

## Building the Project

Make the script executable
```
chmod +x build.sh
```

Pass -h flag to get help with this script
```
./build -h
```

Output:
```
-h	help
-b	build the project
-e	execute the project binary
-r	build and run the project
```

To build the project, pass the -b flag
```
./build.sh -b
```

To execute the project binary, pass the -e flag
```
./build.sh -e
```

To build and run the project, pass the -r flag
```
./build.sh -r
```
